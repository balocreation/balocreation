### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a positive and enthusiastic frontend engineer, who over the years has built up a diverse range of skills. I have extensive experience working both alone and as part of a team on often time-sensitive, challenging blockchain development and web applications that require outstanding creative and technical capabilities and the ability to ensure all work is optimized across a wide range of platforms.
